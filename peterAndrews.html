		<h2>Attitude</h2>

		<p>Peter is a nature enthusiast who loves the outdoors and he has just taken up bird watching. He works long hours and likes to spend the little amount of free time that he has on his new hobby.

				<li>Wants to be able to find information with a simple search</li>
				<li>Wants all of the information in one place and wants it easily accessible and visible</li>
				<li>Wants to be able to access multiple types of information that will help him ID birds; wants more than just pictures</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Frustrations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Does not want to have to create an account to access the information he needs</li>
				<li>Does not want to have to go through multiple pages to find out about a bird's characteristics</li>
				<li>Does not want to have to wait long for a site to load because he needs to be able to access the information quickly</li>
			</ul>
